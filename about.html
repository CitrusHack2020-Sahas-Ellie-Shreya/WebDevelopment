    <h1>Prison-19</h1>
    
    <about><h3><p>
	<i>It is necessary that Governor Newsom passes a bill to protect the incarcerated 
	people in California. The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate and it is worrying 
	how dehumanized people in the system become. Many jails and prisons do not have the 
	adequate funds and means to protect those in their custody. There have been new 
	evidence that many cannot even obtain basic necessities such as soap and proper 
	showers. During one of the most catastrophic times we must not turn a bild eye to 
	those who are incarcerated. <br></br>
	We want this website to be a way of bringing attention to the issues without 
	prison system. The lack of empathy from people in power to those who are most affected 
	is appalling. Speak up for those who cannot and continue practice social distancing.<br></br>
	Thank you.
